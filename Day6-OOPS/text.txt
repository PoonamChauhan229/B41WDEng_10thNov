OOPS:
Object Oriented Programming
JS has inherited some features from JAVA.

features/concepts
Object:Real time entity
Class: class is nothing but the template of object
Methods:It used to communicate between the objects:

Classes:

How to create Classes:
class keyword

Syntax:
class Classname{

} 
class will have it own properties and methods:

Classname as Car:

class Car{

}
Car will have certain properties: Touch and feel
color
name
model
weight
mileage
fuel type
car origin
seats
engine type
electric/non electrical
//safety measures
price
stearing type
launch year
transmission model
AC/NonAC


Call: instance of the class=>creating an object

Syntax:
var abc=new Classname();
//abc=>reference variable

var xyz=new Car();



function xyz(){
    //block of code
}
xyz()
xyz()
xyz()
abc()// throw => not defined


Constructors:
special way of assigning the values to the object
declared with a Constructor keyword
using this itself we can assign the values in class

Syntax:
class Car{
    constructor(a,b,c){
              this.a=a
              this.b=b
              this.c=c

    }
}

var w1=new Car(12,13,45)
var w2=new Car(34,56,78)

this: imaginary reference variable, which is pointed alongwith the reference variable to the same object.

Methods:
//function
function getSum(a,b,c){
    console.log(a+b+c)
}
getSum()


Syntax:
class Car{
    constructor(a,b,c){
              this.a=a
              this.b=b
              this.c=c
    }
    getSum(){//Method
        //block of code for execution
    }
}

var w1=new Car(12,13,45)
var w2=new Car(34,56,78)
